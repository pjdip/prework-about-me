      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I believe LOVE is the only way forward to ensure the maximum number of people acheive a state of well-being.
        I am an Eagle Scout with a BS in mathematics and a BS in chemistry from UMBC
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born, raised, and currently reside in Columbia, MD. I am looking forward to moving to Seattle next summer.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love nature, animals, and hiking in the mountains. I am a beginner rock climber with only gym experience so far.
        I walk 3 miles with my dog and do calisthenics at the local park every morning.
        I love to travel, experience different cultures, and meet new people.
        I am interested in blockchain as a disruptive technology. I hope decentralized finance will force what I perceive to be
        a corrupt global financial system to change or become obsolete.
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I have no single dream job. I am interested in many aspects of existence. I believe I will likely have multiple careers.
        The first order of business is securing financial independence before moving on to less lucrative endeavors.
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>See "Where I'm From"</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Freedom. I want financial freedom and the ability to work remotely for the purposes of travelling and setting my own schedule.
        We only get one life and there are too many things to do to waste away behind a desk from 9 to 5 every weekday.
